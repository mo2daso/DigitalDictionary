Overview
The Digital Dictionary is a machine-readable version of a standard dictionary implemented using a Binary Search Tree (BST). This project provides a convenient and efficient way for users to access word meanings digitally. It includes features such as word insertion, searching, updating, deleting, and displaying all words and their meanings. The dictionary data is stored in a .txt file using file handling in C++.

Tech Stack
Programming Language: C++

Data Structure: Binary Search Tree (BST)

Libraries Used:

<iostream> for input/output operations.

<fstream> for file handling (reading and writing data to a file).

<string> for string manipulation.

<windows.h> for basic system operations (e.g., beep sound).

<cstdio> for standard input/output functions.

<stdlib.h> for standard library functions.

File Handling: Used to store and retrieve dictionary data from a .txt file.

Exception Handling: Implemented to handle errors and exceptions during runtime.

Features
Functional Requirements:
Insert Word/Meaning: Add new words along with their meanings, synonyms, and parts of speech.

Search Word/Meaning: Search for a word and retrieve its meaning, synonym, and part of speech.

Update Meaning: Update the meaning, synonym, or part of speech of an existing word.

Delete Word/Meaning: Remove a word and its associated details from the dictionary.

Display All Words/Meanings: Display all the words and their meanings stored in the dictionary.

File Handling: Save and retrieve dictionary data from a .txt file.

Non-Functional Requirements:
User-friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive menu-driven interface.

Efficient Search Algorithm: Utilizes BST for fast and efficient search operations.

Data Security and Integrity: Ensures data is securely stored and retrieved from the file.

Basic Working
Main Menu: The program starts with a main menu that allows users to choose from various operations:

Insert a new word.

Search for a word.

Update a word's details.

Delete a word.

Display all words.

Exit the program.

Insertion:

The user can input a word, its meaning, synonym, and part of speech.

The word is inserted into the BST, and the data is saved to a .txt file.

Searching:

The user can search for a word, and the program will display its meaning, synonym, and part of speech if the word exists in the dictionary.

Updating:

The user can update the meaning, synonym, or part of speech of an existing word.

The updated data is saved back to the .txt file.

Deletion:

The user can delete a word from the dictionary.

The word is removed from the BST, and the updated dictionary is saved to the .txt file.

Display All Words:

The user can view all the words and their meanings stored in the dictionary.

The data is displayed in an in-order traversal of the BST.

File Handling:

The dictionary data is stored in a .txt file, allowing the program to retain data between sessions.

The program reads from the file when it starts and writes to the file whenever changes are made.

Future Work
Advanced Search Algorithms: Implement more advanced search algorithms for faster and more efficient searches.

Online Integration: Integrate with online dictionaries for real-time updates and additional word details.

Multi-language Support: Add support for multiple languages.

Database Storage: Save data in a database for better scalability and management.

Optimized Menu: Improve the user interface and add more data structures for enhanced functionality.

Conclusion
The Digital Dictionary project provides a computerized version of a traditional dictionary, making it easier and more efficient to access word meanings. By using a Binary Search Tree, the project ensures fast search operations and efficient data management. The project also reduces the need for physical dictionaries, making it a convenient tool for students and professionals alike.
